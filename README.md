# genome_size_dinos
Little project for visualizing the size of the genomes of dinoflagellates

I was inspired by Tom White's post "Genome size" in his Datavision 2020 series (https://tom-e-white.com/datavision/). I downloaded the NCBI data from his github 
(https://github.com/tomwhite/datavision-code/tree/master/05-genome-size) and based my code on his. 
Many thanks to him for making his excellent work public!
